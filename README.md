# Real-time Race Strategy Optimization System

AI generated

## Overview
Design and implement a comprehensive race strategy system that processes live telemetry to optimize pit stops, tire strategy, and race positioning. This system must handle high-frequency data and provide real-time strategic recommendations for a Formula 1 team.

**Time Allocation: 45 minutes**

## Problem Statement
You are tasked with building a telemetry processing system for a Formula 1 team during a race weekend. The system needs to:
- Process high-frequency telemetry data (1000Hz sampling rate)
- Calculate dynamic tire performance models
- Optimize fuel strategy in real-time
- Analyze aerodynamic efficiency with damage assessment
- Predict overtaking opportunities
- Determine optimal pit stop windows

## System Requirements

### Core Processing Functions

#### Function 1: Dynamic Tire Model
```
grip_level = base_grip * (1 - tire_wear_rate * laps_completed)^degradation_factor
lap_time_impact = reference_lap_time / (1 + grip_coefficient * grip_level)
```

#### Function 2: Fuel Strategy Optimization
```
fuel_per_lap = base_consumption + (weight_penalty * current_fuel_load)
remaining_fuel = current_fuel - (fuel_per_lap * remaining_laps)
fuel_save_required = remaining_fuel < 0 ? abs(remaining_fuel) / remaining_laps : 0
```

#### Function 3: Aerodynamic Efficiency
```
drag_coefficient = base_drag + (damage_factor * aero_damage_percentage)
downforce_loss = base_downforce * (1 - aero_damage_percentage)
straight_line_speed = max_speed * (1 - drag_coefficient * air_density_factor)
cornering_speed = base_corner_speed * sqrt(downforce_loss / base_downforce)
```

#### Function 4: Overtaking Opportunity Analysis
```
speed_delta = own_speed - competitor_speed
slipstream_benefit = distance < slipstream_range ? slipstream_factor : 0
overtaking_probability = sigmoid(speed_delta + slipstream_benefit - track_difficulty)
```

#### Function 5: Pit Window Optimization
```
time_loss_pit = pit_lane_time + tire_change_time + pit_lane_penalty
track_position_loss = cars_that_will_pass * average_gap_per_position
net_time_gain = tire_advantage_per_lap * remaining_laps - time_loss_pit - track_position_loss
optimal_pit_lap = argmax(net_time_gain over remaining_laps)
```
